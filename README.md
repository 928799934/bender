bender
======

Bender is a library for building load testing programs. It currently has support and documentation
for Thrift and Http, but can be extended to support any protocol.

*WARNING:* this library is not ready for production. We are busy "dogfooding" it right now, and will
update this README when it is ready. Until then, expect huge changes in the API!

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Bender is to use one of the tutorials:

* [Thrift](https://github.com/pinterest/bender/blob/master/thrift/TUTORIAL.md)
* [HTTP](https://github.com/pinterest/bender/blob/master/http/TUTORIAL.md)

### Documentation

The package documentation is [here](https://github.com/pinterest/bender/blob/master/doc.go).
